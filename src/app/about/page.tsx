          As a seasoned MEAN/MERN Stack developer with over 7 years of hands-on
          experience, I have honed my skills in crafting robust and scalable web
          applications. My proficiency extends across the entire development
          stack, enabling me to seamlessly navigate through MongoDB, Express.js,
          Angular (for MEAN), React.js (for MERN), and Node.js.
